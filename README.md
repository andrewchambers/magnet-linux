# redo-linux

A minimalist, secure and decentralized linux distribution.

## Why does this project exist?

In order to produce reliable software systems we believe it is important users
have the ability to easily modify, debug, recompile any part of the system.

With this in mind, many traditional linux distributions suffer from a few problems:

- If upstream deprecates a software version, you may be unable to reproduce and maintain
  older versions of your software system.
- It can be difficult to make patches and customizations to core software provided with the system.
- Many source based linux distributions omit efficient package precompilation and caching.

So how does redo-linux improve things?

- This source code repository contains nearly everything required to build and run the operating system.
- You can fork, patch and modify the operating system using the same methods as any other software.
- You can securely use precompiled packages with transparent recompilation when none are found.
- Package caches are hosted on p2p networks and can be entirely self hosted.
- All external source code is mirrored on p2p networks and can be self hosted.

## Who should consider using redo-linux?

Nobody yet (unless you want to participate in the design process).

In the future it will be for:

- Professional software engineers and organizations interested in reproducible software systems.
- Enthusiasts and advanced linux users.
- People who want to a more decentralized linux distribution for whatever reason.

## Why is it called redo-linux?

The core of the system is a software build tool called 'redo' that is simple and powerful.

## Project principles

- Keep it simple.
- Empower the user.

## Project status

This project is a *vaporware* prototype. We will develop it as long as there is a need
and interest. Once it is a functioning and useful system we *may* remove the prototype label.

## Sponsoring the project
