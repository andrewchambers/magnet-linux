# magnet-linux

A minimalist, decentralized linux distribution and package tree.

## What is special about magnet-linux?

- It is built from source, but has optional package caching (similar to nixos/guix).
- It can be used from within other linux distributions without root or docker.
- It can be used to create reproducible software environments (e.g. for reproducible experiments and software development).
- It is by and for advanced users who appreciate minimalism.
- Avoids single points of failure by using p2p networks (bit torrent) and distributed version control for hosting and distribution.

## Who should consider using magnet-linux?

Nobody yet (unless you want to participate in the design process).

In the future it will be for:

- Advanced linux users.
- People who require reproducible and long lasting software environments.
- People who want a more decentralized linux distribution for whatever reason.

## Project principles

- Keep it simple.
- Empower the user.

## Project status

This project is a *vaporware* prototype. We will develop it as long as there is a need
and interest. Once it is a functioning and useful system we *may* remove the prototype label.
